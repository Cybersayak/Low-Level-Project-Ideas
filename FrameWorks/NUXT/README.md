      // ... other lifecycle hooks
    };
    this.options = options;
  }

  // Register a module with its options
  registerModule(moduleFunction, moduleOptions = {}) {
    // Module registration logic
    const module = {
      func: moduleFunction,
      options: moduleOptions
    };
    
    // Call module with context and options
    moduleFunction.call(this, {
      options: this.options,
      addPlugin: this.addPlugin.bind(this),
      extendRoutes: this.extendRoutes.bind(this),
      // ... other context methods
    }, moduleOptions);
    
    this.modules.set(moduleFunction, module);
  }

  // Hook registration mechanism
  hook(name, fn) {
    if (!this.hooks[name]) {
      this.hooks[name] = [];
    }
    this.hooks[name].push(fn);
  }

  // Execute hooks in sequence
  async callHook(name, ...args) {
    if (!this.hooks[name]) {
      return;
    }
    
    for (const fn of this.hooks[name]) {
